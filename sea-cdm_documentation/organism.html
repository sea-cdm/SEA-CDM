                    This table contains a list of all organisms listed in an experiment as part of the SEA CDM.
                    Each organism is listed as an instance within a dataset; the same organism from different studies
                    will not be linked unless there is a connection between <code>foreign_id</code> values.
                    An organism is a necessary component for a biological experiment.
                </p>
