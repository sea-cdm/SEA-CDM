SEA-CDM: Study-Experiment-Assay Common Data Model

SEA-CDM is a common data model (CDM) designed to support standardized representation and integration of data from various experimental studies. The current focus of SEA-CDM is on biomedical studies. 

SEA-CDM was initiated by He Lab in the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
